# cleanswe

Change variable names to snake case using the excellent janitor package. Split fields that have both a code and a name to seperate varables (only for SCB data). Change å, ä, ö to aa, ae, oe. This package is mostly for my own personal use.

You can instal this package with:

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("christianlindell/cleanswe")
