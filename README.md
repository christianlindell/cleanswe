# cleanswe

Change variable names to snake case using the excellent janitor package. Split fields that have both a code and a name to seperate varables (only for SCB data). Change å, ä, ö to aa, ae, oe. This package is mostly for my own personal use.

<<<<<<< HEAD
For now you can separete code and names into two different varaiables if you have downloaded data from Statistics Sweden (SCB) for three types of variables: Industry (following the standards SNI92, SNI2002 and SNI2007), ockupation, and region.
